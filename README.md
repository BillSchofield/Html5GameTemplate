# HTML5GameTemplate

## What does the template code give you

HTML5 Boilerplate is a simple example of Test Driven game-like behavior
implemented in Javascript using a functional object creation model (as described in
'Javascript: the Good Parts, Chapter 5).

The sample contains examples of:
* Keyboard Input
* Mouse Input
* Polygon drawing
* Sprite drawing
* Simple object motion (using an Euler integrator)

## JavaScript: the Good Parts

### Key Points from the Book

#### JavaScript has some hideously Bad Parts
* Programming model based on global variables

#### We use JavaScript because: 
* It's more or less mandatory for building modern Web Apps
* It has delightfully Good Parts:
    * Functions as first class objects
    * Powerful object literal notation


### Some important aspects of JavaScript:
* Uses prototypical inheritance instead of class inheritance
* Loose/weak Typing
What do you expect these lines to display.

```javascript
console.log(true + 5 + "10");
console.log(true + "10");
```
Type these into a JS console and see if you were right.

* Duck Typing
