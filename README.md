# HTML5GameTemplate

HTML5 Boilerplate is a simple example of Test Driven game-like behavior
implemented in Javascript using a functional object creation model (as described in
'Javascript: the Good Parts, Chapter 5).

The sample contains examples of:
* Keyboard Input
* Mouse Input
* Polygon drawing
* Sprite drawing
* Simple object motion (using an Euler integrator)
